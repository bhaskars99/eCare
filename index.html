                     Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed. People get bursitis by overusing a joint. It can also be caused by an injury. It usually occurs at the knee or elbow. Kneeling or leaning your elbows on a hard surface for a long time can make bursitis start. Doing the same kinds of movements every day or putting stress on joints increases your risk.
                  </p>
                  <b>Symptoms</b>
                  <p>Elbow/arm bursitis include Bruising, redness, or warmth around your elbow, pain and swelling</p>

                  <ul>
                     <p>Start R.I.C.E. measures soon after your injury.</p>
                     <li><b>Rest :</b> Take a break from your normal activities.</li>
                     <li><b>Ice :</b> Place an ice pack or bag of frozen peas on the sore area for 15 to 20 minutes three times a day.</li>
                     <li><b>Compression :</b> Use a compression bandage to reduce swelling.</li>

                  <p>
                     Heart disease remains the leading killer of adults over age 65, accounting for 489,722 deaths in 2014. As a chronic condition, heart disease affects 37 percent of men and 26 percent of women 65 and older, according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. As people age, they're increasingly living with risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, that increase the chances of having a stroke or developing heart disease. Dr. Bernard’s advice for addressing this senior health risk not only helps with heart disease but can improve senior health across the board:<i> “Exercise, eat well, get a good night’s rest. Eating well means eating in a fashion that will allow you to keep a healthy weight with a well-balanced and healthy diet."</i>

                  <h2 class="sub-header">Respiratory Diseases</h2>
                  <p>
                     Chronic lower respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are the third most common cause of death among people 65 and older, with 124,693 deaths in 2014, according to the CDC( Centers for Disease Control) . Among people 65 and older, about 10 percent of men and 13 percent of women are living with asthma, and 10 percent of men and 11 percent of women are living with chronic bronchitis or emphysema, according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. Although having a chronic respiratory disease increases senior health risks, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia and other infections, getting lung function tests and taking the correct medication, or using oxygen as instructed, will go a long way toward preserving senior health and your quality of life.

                  <p>
                     The CDC( Centers for Disease Control) estimates that 25 percent of people ages 65 and older are living with diabetes, a significant senior health risk. According to CDC data, diabetes caused 54,161 deaths among adults over age 65 in 2014. Diabetes can be identified and addressed early with simple blood tests for blood sugar levels. The sooner you know that you have or are at risk for diabetes, the sooner you can start making changes to control the disease and improve your long-term senior health outlook.

                  <p>
                     Obesity is an important senior health risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer — all chronic conditions that impact quality of life. As the numbers on the scale increase, so does the risk for disease. Of the adults between 65 and 74, 36.2 percent of men and 40.7 percent of women are obese — meaning that their body mass index is greater than or equal to 30 — according to the CDC( Centers for Disease Control) . It can also be a signal that an older adult isn’t as active or mobile as he or she once was.

                     The cells of the immune system act more slowly. These cells identify and destroy foreign substances such as bacteria, other infecting microbes, and probably cancer cells. This immune slowdown may partly explain several findings associated with aging:

                  <p>
                     Sometimes referred to as psychiatric or psychologic disorders, mental health disorders are caused by complex interactions between physical, psychologic, social, cultural, and hereditary influences. They involve disturbances in thinking, emotion, and/or behavior. Small disturbances in these aspects of life are common, but when such disturbances distress the person greatly, interfere with daily life, or both, they are considered mental illness or a mental health disorder. The effects of mental illness may be long-lasting or temporary.
